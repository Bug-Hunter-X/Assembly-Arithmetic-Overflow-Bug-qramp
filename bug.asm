```assembly
mov ax, 1000h ; Load a 16-bit value into AX
add ax, bx ; Attempt to add the contents of BX to AX
```

This code snippet has a potential bug where the value in `BX` is larger than what `AX` can hold. In assembly the size of the registers matter, and an overflow could lead to unexpected results.  If BX contains a value that results in a sum exceeding 16-bits (FFFFh), then the upper bits of the sum will be truncated, leading to an incorrect result. This is an example of an arithmetic overflow error.
